    <h3 class="session-title">Blockchain Technology and Digital Twin Distributed Data Fabric for Oil & Gas Applications</h3>
    <p class="session-synopsis">
        <strong>Course Overview: </strong>
        Ren Datasim (RDS) has formed by a group of Chevron retirees in Houston, US, since 2021. Currently, RDS is working 
        with First Genesis (FG) in Houston, US, which made it possible using Oil/Gas Production and Process Operation Digital 
        Twin (DT) technology combined with actor model and blockchain data distribution and data fabric technology on Xenese platform. 
        This innovation provides a real-time digital representation of physical systems, fluid produced, and their associated 
        production workflow, which is combined with machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) models to enable predictive 
        analytics and prescriptive insights.
        Actor models can provide distributed control and coordination across multiple platforms, such as cloud, edge, and IoT, 
        and can link to existing systems and processes to enable automated operation workflow and data analysis.
        By leveraging the capabilities of a digital twin technology with actor models built on the blockchain Xenese platform to 
        create an exact virtual representation of an oil and gas production facility operations and workflows. The operators can 
        gain the ability to better monitor, predict, and optimize their operations. This could result in significant cost savings, 
        improved safety, and overall efficiency benefits for each functional sector, including interactive coordinates.
        As summary, the digital twin solution combined with actor models built on the blockchain Xenese platform, is combining the 
        oil/gas modelling technologies, actor model interface management advantages, and blockchain distributed data management all 
        together, and allow the digital twin could be scalable, not losing any rigorous behaviour analysis, and enable to have a various 
        accurate digital virtual representation for a very large facility including a lot of detailed edge systems in real time.

                Dr Ren has over 36 years of experience in both the oil and gas upstream and downstream industry 
                and is well connected to the upstream and downstream production community worldwide, particularly 
                in process modelling and simulation, and process online solution applications. <br>
                Dr Ren retired from Chevron in 2021. In the past, he had worked at Stone & Webster as Sr. Process 
                Engineer; at Invensys SimSci as Principal Simulation Tech Lead; and at Chevron as Advisor of Simulation 
                Engineering. He had led a team that developed a few large-scale processes and online solutions for Deepwater 
                facilities and subsea pipeline networks. <br>
                Dr Ren was a principal inventor of US Patent 9500035B2 for Dual Gradient Managed Pressure Drilling Online Solution. 
                He has created another US Patent in application with Mitsubishi Heavy Industry in 2022. He had also as principal 
                inventor of the Erosion Index and FIV Index ML model for the DeepStar Research Program. <br> <br>
