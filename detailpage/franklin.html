    <h3 class="session-title"><strong>The Enabling Role of Energy Storage in Energy Transition: </strong>The Importance of Energy Storage Systems in the De-carbonization roadmap</h3>
    <p class="session-synopsis">
        Storing energy for future use when and where it is most needed, is critical for energy security and increased renewable energy production. 
        Most renewable generation technologies are both intermittent and seasonal, which means that energy storage is essential to store and supply 
        reliable energy when it is needed. Thus, energy storage is essential to enable an energy transition, and it is important that the world starts 
        to deploy energy storage at scale to enable the net zero transition. Given the immense value of storage in helping integrate ever-increasing 
        shares of renewables, it is no surprise that storage deployments are quickly increasing. In a net-zero world, the IEA forecast that energy 
        storage will account for 70% of all renewable energy expenditure, eclipsing the investments in wind, solar and hydrogen. It is important that 
        policymakers, industry, and other stakeholders work together to create an enabling regulatory framework that will allow the energy storage sector 
        to thrive. 
        This break-out session aims to discuss the various energy storage systems, the benefits, opportunities and potential challenges as we accelerate 
        to a net-zero world.
