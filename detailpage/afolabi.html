    <h3 class="session-title"><strong>Access to Green Mini-Grids:  </strong>Accelerating Electricity Access Through Clean Energy Mini-Grid Solutions</h3>
    <p class="session-synopsis">
        <Strong>Synopsis: </Strong>
        Access to energy is a requirement for socio-economic development. Yet several people in the world and 
        especially Africa still do not have access to electricity. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), 
        733 million people do not have access to electricity worldwide, 570 million of whom are in Africa. 
        To close this energy access gap, investment in Green Mini-Grids is required to provide access to electricity 
        for half a billion people in developing countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. Green Mini-Grids will 
        also provide critical stimulus to development in rural areas and displacing caron intensive fuel sources.
        This session aims to explain what green mini-grid is, and the key role green min-grids is expected to play in 
        creating power access not only in Africa but the world. The session would also highlight the impact of right 
        policies and investment as well as the challenges in the development of green mini-grids
