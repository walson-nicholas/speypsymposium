            Dr. Jude Osimobi (PMP) is an Earth and Environmental Scientist with over a decade of industry 
            experience. He is currently a Geophysicist at Shell. Jude holds a BSc. in Physics from Delta 
            State University Abraka, an MSc in Petroleum Geophysics from Imperial College London, a second 
            MSc in Environmental/Radiation Physics and a PhD in Environmental/Radiation Physics both from 
            University of Port Harcourt. 
            Jude loves to give back to the society through coaching and mentoring and he’s currently the 
            Technical Information Chair for SPE Port Section 103. He is also a Shell’s visiting lecturer 
            at the Center of Excellence in Geosciences and Petroleum Engineering, University of Benin. 
            Dr. Osimobi is an astute researcher with several technical publications to his name and winner 
            of the Best Technical Paper Award at NAPE Conference 2022
            Jude Osimobi is passionate about the environment as he believes that man is both the source 
            and sink. Dr. Jude believes that maintaing equilibrium balance between deleterious human 
            causative activities and providing energy is critical for man. His life goal as he has remarked 
            in several environmental/energy publications and conferences is to find the 'thin' line between 
            energy and environment as we need both to survive.
            M.C and moderator Captain J likes to deliver events and programs like this, play chess, watch 
            and play football and also finds pleasure in travelling, having travelled to over 18 countries 
            across all the continents except Australia. He is married to Margaret-Mary and blessed with four 
            kids, two of which are twins.
