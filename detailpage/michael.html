    <h3 class="session-title"><strong>Natural Gas & LNG: </strong>Helping Secure a Sustainable Energy Supply</h3>
    <p class="session-synopsis">
        <Strong>Synopsis: </Strong>
        Meeting the growing global demand for energy, while tackling climate change and pollution, is a 
        fundamental challenge facing society. Natural gas as an easy-to-store, lower-carbon option 
        can help to meet that challenge by reducing emissions, while providing an uninterrupted flexible 
        energy supply in tandem with intermittent output from wind and solar. It is also one of the few 
        energy sources that can be used across all sectors of the global economy. It is used to generate 
        electricity, heat homes, provide heat for essential industrial processes, and fuel the transport 
        of people and goods.  It is thus clear that natural gas plays a key role in the energy transition.
