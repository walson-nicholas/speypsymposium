    <h3 class="session-title"><strong>GHG Emission Reduction and Climate Change</strong></h3>
    <p class="session-synopsis">
        <Strong>Synopsis: </Strong>
        To avoid the worst impacts of climate change, the science is clear that emissions need to be reduced by almost half 
        by 2030 and reach net zero by 2050. However, meeting the global GHG emission reduction levels and achieving the net 
        zero target by 2050 dictated by the Paris Agreement will demand long-lasting solutions and comprehensive climate action strategies. 
        Today, energy is responsible for two-thirds of global greenhouse gas emissions. Oil (32%), natural gas (21%) and coal 
        (29%) together make up 82% of the worldâ€™s energy mix, according to the IEA. The remaining fifth comes from biomass, 
        waste, hydropower, nuclear, and other renewables (such as solar and wind). Achieving a net zero world will require 
        ending reliance on fossil fuels and investing in alternative sources of energy that are clean, accessible, affordable, 
        sustainable, and reliable. Even though achieving this goal is challenging, it remains the only real solution to combat 
        climate change and preserve the planet for future generations. Thus, a transformation of the global energy system is 
        required to avoid the serious consequences of climate change and at the same time address the rising demand for global energy.
        This break-out session aims to discuss why net zero is important and how it can be achieved. The session will also highlight 
        the need to ensure that global commitments and net zero pledges are turned into action.

            Yetunde Deborah Fadeyi is an energy and sustainability practitioner with over a decade of experience 
            exploring the nexus between renewable energy, food security, climate-smart health programs, and global 
            health as well as developing scientific research, communication, project management and policy advocacy 
            strategies for these projects. Deborah holds a Master's degree in Mechanical Engineering - specializing 
            in Sustainable Energy and Environment, from Cardiff University, United Kingdom, under the Chevening/FCDO 
            Scholarship. She also possesses several qualifications, including from the Hague Academy for Local Governance, 
            the Netherlands, on inclusive service delivery and Nonprofit Management Program for Senior Executives at Lagos 
            Business School, Pan Atlantic University. She has participated in several policy sessions with international 
            organizations such as IEA, BrainTrust, and governments strengthening the political will to propose people-centred 
            transitions and how to mitigate the effects on marginalized communities as a developmental issue for an equitable 
            and just transition is one of her key strengths. She led and supported interventions for 11 unserved communities 
            without prior access to electricity for 5,000 beneficiaries and enabled over 500 youths in Nigeria and Ghana to 
            deliver advocacy campaigns toward environmental sustainability. She has participated in several policy sessions 
            with international organisations and governments using practical solutions as a part of her overall professional 
            practice. She currently works with the Oyo State Government through a Public Private Partnership as Chief Sustainability 
            Officer, restructuring the waste management system for Oyo state from Cradle to Cradle. This role features Deborah 
            leading Community Development initiatives and forging innovative partnerships across other private and public sectors, 
            developing multifaceted and inclusive strategies. She has successfully reformed waste delivery as a service considering 
            socioeconomic groups and has kickstarted the delivery of turning all illegal and decommissioned municipal dumpsites into 
            waste-energy plants to power hospitals, streetlights, and stadiums, among others. She is currently building Vectar Energy, 
            which is positioned to fundamentally change how our world uses power via the integration of incentivized fintech with 
            cleantech for sustainable solutions, seed-funded by AllOn, Shell Company. The flagship product, Vectar Eco, has been 
            described as an ultimate replacement for small petrol generators and reiterated by experts at Lawrence Berkeley National 
            Laboratory, California. Her ultimate goal is to leverage her competencies across policies, research and practice, and 
            entrepreneurship domains to democratize energy access and sustainability, ultimately enabling a smooth energy transition 
            for sustainability for millions of people. She is a US TechWomen scholar, One Young World Scholar and a nominee for community 
            action for The Future Africa Awards.
